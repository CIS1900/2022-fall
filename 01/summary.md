# Class 1 summary

We got through the material up to and not including debugging, which was left to reading on your own.

We tried exercise 1 but did not go over it, and I will do so next class.

Exercise 3 will be left to next class.
For exercise 2, one answer is that it can be useful if you have a pointer, and you want to write a function to make that pointer point to something else.
Another answer is that you may want a multi-dimensional array.
A pointer to int can represent an array, so a pointer to pointer to int can represent a 2d array.
