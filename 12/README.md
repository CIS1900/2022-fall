## Value Template Arguments

In addition to type arguments, templates can also have value arguments.
Using these instead of regular function arguments is sometimes *necessary*, for example for arrays, where the size of the array must be a compile-time constant:

INSERT array.cpp

This example also has the benefit of allocating an array on the stack instead of the heap, avoiding having to manually manage the array allocated using `new []` if we made the size of the array a regular parameter.

Other times, value template arguments are useful for performance, since, as usual, the template will act as a code-generation mechanism.

INSERT pow.cpp

In this example, we avoid having to pass in `2` as a normal function argument at runtime, instead generating custom code for the case when `base` is `2`.
Doing this may also aid the compiler in doing optimizations, since it sees that the code is just multiplying by `2` inside a loop, and can be replaced with a single bit shift.

## `constexpr`

While we talked about compile-time constants above, how exactly do we characterize these constants?
`const` may seem tempting, but it is not sufficient.
`const` is basically a *promise* that you won't change this variable in the future.
For example, we could obtain an `int` from the user, and then copy that into a `const int`:
```c++
int i;
cin >> i;
const int c {i};
```
`c` is *not* a compile-time constant here, though it is `const`.

`constexpr`, standing for *constant expression*, is a stronger notion of immutability than `const`.
A variable that is declared `constexpr` means that it will be known as compile time, and is suitable for use as a template argument:

INSERT constexpr1.cpp

`constexpr` variables are also `const` automatically, and are useful for declaring constants, similar to how `#define` is used in C.
While this is useful, the real power of `constexpr` is the ability to define `constexpr` *functions*, which will force computation to happen at compile time.

A function can be declared as `constexpr`, which signals to the compiler that this function should be run at compile-time.
There are some restrictions on the function for it to be `constexpr`, such as that it can only use local variables (no globals!) and cannot have other side effects.
These restrictions are similar to pure functions in functional programming and are detailed [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constexpr).

INSERT constexpr2.cpp

A `constexpr` function can also be run on non-`constexpr` arguments, in which case it will run normally (at runtime).
When a `constexpr` function is run on `constexpr` arguments, then the output is `constexpr` as well, and this is all computed at compile-time.
This example runs the `constexpr` function `factorial` on a `constexpr`, `12`, and computes the factorial of `12` at compile-time.
To verify this, you can run `g++ -s -S constexpr2.cpp` to see the assembly output of the compiler in `constexpr2.s`.
`-s` removes debugging information, and `-S` generates assembly instead of an executable.
You can see that the answer is precomputed and stored in the assembly, and not computed on demand by the program.

## Template Metaprogramming

*Metaprogramming* is where programs can themselves deal with programs as data.
Templates are already an instance of metaprogramming---they generate code for you.

The term *template metaprogramming* in C++ typically refers to more complex usage of templates: using templates to do compile-time compilation, similar to `constexpr` functions.
This style is actually Turing-complete[^1], and was not the original intent of the C++ designers.
Basically, it is possible to use class templates as a functional programming language, where template specializations are the base cases, and values are stored as `static` class variables:

INSERT fib.cpp

In this example, we define a class template for calculating the $N$th Fibonnaci number.
It is essential that we store the value of interest in a `static` variable, rather than in a member function.
If we instead defined a `int value()` member function, then `fib<3>::value()` would expand to `fib<2>::value() + fib<1>::value()`, which would result in these functions being called at runtime, defeating the purpose of template metaprogramming.
By using a `static` variable, `fib<3>::value` expands out to `fib<2>::value + fib<1>::value`, which is `1 + 1`, and the compiler simplifies that to the answer, `2`.

Note that for template specializations, the general case must come first, with specializations following it.

As a second example, we will consider the [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture), which has to do with sequences of positive integers.
When the number `n` is even, the next number in the sequence is `n / 2`.
When the number `n` is odd, then the next number is `3n + 1`.
Experimentally, no matter what number you start from, the sequence goes to `1` eventually, but there is no proof that the sequence will always reach `1` from any starting number.

This example will focus on counting how many steps it takes to reach 1, starting from an arbitrary starting number:

INSERT collatz.cpp

This program uses a helper class template, `CollatzHelper`, to use a second template parameter to keep track of whether the first parameter is even or odd.
It is capable of doing quite a lot of work at compile-time, though this program may not compile on your machine, due to the recursion being too deep.
Using GCC, the error message mentions the `ftemplate-depth` flag to change the depth of template instantiations, and increasing it to `1000` successfully computes the number of steps for all of the examples in `main`.

Compared to `constexpr` functions, template metaprogramming is far more cumbersome, though occasionally it can be more expressive.
For example, templates can deal with any type, whereas `constexpr` can only deal with simple types.
`constexpr` is also a newer feature than templates, so you may see more instances of template metaprogramming in older code.
