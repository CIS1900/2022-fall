## Exercise 1: Debug and fix the class

Consider [this](list1.cpp) implementation of a linked list, where we are following the rule of 3.
There is a bug with the class.
Try to write some test code in main that finds this bug, causing your program to crash or leak memory.
Then, fix the class so that it works properly.

## Exercise 2: Debug and fix the class

Consider [this](list2.cpp) implementation of a linked list, where we are following the rule of 5, but the copy operations are disabled, so the linked list can only be moved.
There are two bugs with the class.
Try to write some test code in main that finds each bug, causing your program to crash or leak memory.
Then, fix the class so that it works properly.
