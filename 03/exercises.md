## Exercise 1

Write a program that reads an `int` followed by a `string` from stdin.
Try running the program with a variety of inputs.
Does the number need to be separated from the string by a space? How about many spaces? A new line?

What happens if you run the program but provide input of the wrong format?
How does the `istream` signal that it encounted something unexpected?
